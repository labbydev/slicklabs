          <p class="lede">At SlickLabs we combine art and science to help you transform great ideas into beautiful products. Whereas most prototyping companies ask for a static set of requirements only to return weeks later with “something close,” our engineers, developers and designers are fully committed to keeping you engaged every step of the way … to deliver your idea exactly how it should be.</p>
